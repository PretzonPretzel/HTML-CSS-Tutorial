    [Chorus]
I'm just out on my own
Searching for the real reason to feel human
Outside my comfort zone
That it where i find a way out
And break away from you

    [Instrumental]

    [Chorus]
I'm just out on my own
Searching for the real reason to feel human
Outside my comfort zone
That it where i find a way out
And break away from you

    [Instrumental]

    [Chorus]
I'm just out on my own
Searching for the real reason to feel human
Outside my comfort zone
That it where i find a way out
And break away from you

I'm just out on my own
Searching for the real reason to feel human
Outside my comfort zone
That it where i find a way out
And break away from you

    [Bridge]
I'm out of time
Searching for the reason
Answers that are hiddеn
I need to
Break free from my
Deepest complication
I need to know
I'm not alone

    [Instrumental]

    [Bridge]
I'm out of timе
Searching for the reason
Answers that are hidden
I need to
Break free from my
Deepest complication
I need to know
I'm not alone

    [Drop]

    [Chorus]
I'm just out on my own
Searching for the real reason to feel human
Outside my comfort zone
That it where i find a way out and break away from you

    [Outro]
I'm just out, out, out
I'm just out, out on my own
I'm just out, out, out
I'm just out on my own
I'm just out, out, out
I'm just out, out on my own
I'm just out, out, out
I'm just out on my own
